## Description

_This website is a survey that will provide course suggestions for future students at [**Epicodus**](https://www.epicodus.com/). The survey asks the user 6 questions based on personality and interest. Once the user submits the form, based on their choices, they will be prompt a message of the suggested course they should enroll in and a brief description of what that course entails._

_This was a practice project I worked on as a student for [**Epicodus**](https://www.epicodus.com/). The project was design for students to showcase what they learned from regarding basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts. Bootstrap was used to cover basic form and structure of the page. jQuery was used to target user input and provide a course suggestion based on branching, i.e. if and else statements. jQuery was also used to return survey if returned to home page._
